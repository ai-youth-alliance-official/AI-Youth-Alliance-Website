            Nowadays, everyone knows what AI (Artificial Intelligence) is. But not everyone realizes that AI is used everywhere, few people can imagine the range of AI. For example, AI is implemented in digital assistants, search engines, social media, online shopping, robots, transportation and navigation, text editing and autocorrect. But why is AI everywhere? Simple — because people need it!

            ● <b>More Innovative Automation:</b> Sometimes, there are some technologies that can be repetitive and time-consuming, and AI makes these processes faster and without any issues
        </p>
        <p>
            ● <b>Predict Human Behavior:</b> AI can predict human behavior that can benefit businesses to understand and anticipate customers needs and what the customer wants to buy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            AI, or Artificial Intelligence, shapes our world like a prism, breaking light into vibrant colors. AI significantly impacts many areas of our lives, from personal assistants like Siri and Alexa to advanced medical diagnostics that detect diseases early.

            <h3>Different uses of AI</h3>
            Here is the question, where AI can be used? AI can be used in nearly every field, including healthcare, entertainment, and self-driving cars.
        </p>
        <p>
            ● <b>Healthcare:</b>  AI can predict and diagnose disease faster than most medical professionals. Due to the development in technology, AI is speeding the process of designing the drugs and predicting any side effects.
        <p>
            ● <b>Entertainment:</b>  Social media services such as Instagram and YouTube use AI to recommend videos and content based on the user's interest.
        </p>
        <p>
            ● <b>Self-driving cars:</b>  AI plays a key role in autonomous vehicles, analyzing road conditions and making decisions to ensure safety.
        </p>
        <p>
            Right now, there are a lot of young minds that are developing AI solutions and apps. For example, there are some high school and college students that are making AI-tools that can help to monitor health, for example, tracking the beating of the heart, counting the steps you made for a day.
        </p>
        </ul>

            <h3>AI and Ethics</h3>
            While AI has many benefits, it still can have some problems and concerns with biased decisions and with privacy.
        </p>
        <p>
            ● <b>Bias and Unfair Decisions:</b>  AI can predict and diagnose disease faster than most medical professionals. Due to the development in technology, AI is speeding the process of designing the drugs and predicting any side effects.
        <p>
            ● <b>Privacy concerns:</b>  One of the concerned problems of AI is lack of the strength of protection of personal data. Continuous data collection by AI can potentially lead to the exposure of sensitive and personal information. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Young people are already making AI fairer and safer for people by creating a path to safer AI by mixing technical, ethical, legal and societal aspects. For example, in a technical way, the younger generation will strengthen encryption. So, they will use and implement a lot of different sectors and industries of other subjects in order to make AI safer and fairer.

            <h3>AI in Creativity</h3>
            Many people think that AI is only for the tech industry. However, AI is also used frequently in creative fields such as art, music, and even in film works.

        </p>
        <p>
            ● <b>Art::</b>  DALL-E and DeepArt, AI tools which allow creators to generate art by combining new filters and tools in order to create a masterpiece.
        <p>
            ● <b>Privacy concerns:</b>  There are a lot of AI-powered tools and systems that can compose a song by using existing genres of music. Songwriters are already using it to make the content in seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
            ● <b>Movies:</b>  Directors can create a plot in seconds by using AI. And nowadays, few people spend a lot of money on creating visual effects because AI creates and develops it all.
        </p>
        <p>
            Young people are also using AI in creative ways. For example, high school students experiment with AI tools to design unusual digital art, compose music, and even direct short films
        </p>
        </ul>
    </div>

            <h3>What's Next for AI?</h3>
            In the future, we expect to have new ways of implementing AI. For example, there are some that are used even now and will be used in the future.

        </p>
        <p>
            ● <b>Solving Global Problems:</b>  There are some global problems that humans are experiencing right now, and one of them is connected with the environment. Nowadays, some machine learning models are predicting natural disasters in order to solve climate change issues.            
        <p>
            ● <b>Space exploration:</b>  Even now, we use machine learning models to find the best way to land the spacecraft on a planet. However, we anticipate that in the future, it will be improved and we will use it in other ways of exploring space.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next generation of AI innovators will be playing a crucial role in advancing and developing AI in the right way. Young minds are more creative, and they have more approaches in order to make AI to solve global issues. Programs like AI research camps, and institutes will make a large contribution in achieving these advancements.
